# Responsive Web Design 101

## School Supplies

1. Download [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) if you don't have it already.
2. You'll need a code editor. I prefer [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). Microsoft Word doesn't count.
3. Bring phones and tablets to experiment with.
