# Responsive Web Design 101



## School Supplies

> You're going to learn about responsive design by building a responsive web page. You don't need any coding experience and we'll be doing just enough to illustrate key concepts. 

1. Download [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) if you don't have it already.
2. You'll need a code editor. I prefer [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). Microsoft Word doesn't count.
3. Bring devices to experiment with.
