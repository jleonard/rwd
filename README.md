# Responsive Web Design

## School Supplies

1. Download [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) if you don't have it already.
2. You'll need a code editor. I prefer [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). Don't you dare think about trying to use something like Microsoft Word.
